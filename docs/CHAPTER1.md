4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: The system provides valuable insights through analytics and reporting features.

5. **Standardization**: The platform helps standardize emergency response procedures and protocols.

6. **Training and Preparedness**: The system can be used for training and simulation exercises.

## Definition of Terms

1. **ResQ**: The name of the Disaster and Incident Response Platform.

2. **Emergency Response**: The organized response to an emergency situation to minimize its impact.

3. **Resource Management**: The process of planning, scheduling, and allocating resources for emergency operations.

4. **Real-time Communication**: Instant exchange of information between users of the platform.

5. **Situational Awareness**: The understanding of environmental elements and events with respect to time and space.

6. **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.

7. **User Interface**: The means by which users interact with the platform.

8. **Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of users accessing the platform.

9. **Authorization**: The process of determining what actions a user is allowed to perform.

10. **Emergency Alert**: A notification system for broadcasting important emergency information.
